The title or a brief description of the event. This should\n    capture the essence of what the event is about.\n\n    summary: A more detailed summary or description of the event. This\n    provides additional context and information about the event.\n\n    sources: References that report and/or describe the event.\n\n    expires: Time after which the RiskEvent is no longer 'in-effect'.\n\n    type: Identifies the type of the event. The event type is the main\n    driver of event processing, e.g. when it expires, how it propagates to\n    entities, etc.\n\n    start_date: Time the event began\n\n    end_date: Time the event ended\n\n    last_propagation: Last time this event propagated to entities. Will be\n    'None' if it has never been propagated.\n\n    last_notification: Last time notifications for this event were\n    published. Will be 'None' if no notifications have been generated.\n\n    hidden: A 'hidden' RiskEvent has been un-propagated from all Entities so\n    that it is no longer affecting any scores, and should not be displayed\n    to any users. This field is temporary and will be displaced by\n    'review_status' once accompanying features for 'review_status' are\n    complete.\n\n    review_status: New RiskEvents are created in a 'pending' state. Pending\n    RiskEvents are invisible to end users, and have no impact on Entity\n    scores or other calculations. On human review, a RiskEvent may be\n    either 'approved' or 'denied'. If the RiskEvent is approved, it is\n    propagated to affected Entities, where it will impact Entity risk\n    scoring and other calculations. If denied, a corresponding\n    'RiskEventFeedback' record exists that explains why the RiskEvent is\n    irrelevant or inappropriate. RiskEvents are allowed to transition\n    between 'approved' and 'denied' any number of times, though such\n    transitions should be rare.\n\n    extraction_metadata: LLM vendor, model, and schema used to extract Risk\n    Event information from input text. This information can be used to\n    compare the performance of different prompts and models.\n\n    force_expired: If True, the expiration time set at creation has been\n    manually overridden to 'force' the record to expire.\n\n    original_expiry: If exists and is non-null, contains the expiration time\n    from before the document was force-expired."},"BlockAGIResearch":{"properties":{"created_at":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","title":"Created
